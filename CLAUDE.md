- **Repository**: drik/inventry
- **Primary branch**: main
- **Status**: Newly initialized

## Repository Structure

```

├── CLAUDE.md          # This file - AI assistant guide
└── README.md          # Project readme
```

> As the project grows, update this section to reflect the directory layout.

## Tech Stack

Not yet established. Update this section once the tech stack is chosen (e.g., framework, language, database, styling).

## Development Commands

No build tooling is configured yet. Update this section as commands are added:

```shell
# Example placeholders - replace once tooling is set up
# npm install        # Install dependencies
# npm run dev        # Start dev server
# npm run build      # Production build
# npm test           # Run tests
# npm run lint       # Run linter
```

## Conventions for AI Assistants

### General Rules

- Read existing code before making changes; never modify files you haven't read.
- Keep changes minimal and focused on the task at hand. Avoid unrelated refactors.
- Do not add features, abstractions, or error handling beyond what is requested.
- Do not create documentation files unless explicitly asked.
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones.

### Code Style

Once the project has code, document style conventions here (naming, formatting, import order, etc.). Until then, follow whatever conventions the first committed code establishes.

### Git Workflow

- Commit messages should be concise and describe the "why" over the "what."
- Do not force-push or amend commits unless explicitly asked.
- Do not push to main/master without permission.

### Testing

No test framework is configured yet. When one is added, document:
- How to run tests
- Test file naming conventions
- Where test files live
- Coverage expectations

## Architecture Notes

No architecture decisions have been made yet. As the project evolves, document:
- Data models and schemas
- API design and endpoints
- Authentication/authorization approach
- State management strategy
- Deployment configuration

## Known Issues / TODOs

- Project needs initial scaffolding (tech stack selection, tooling setup)
